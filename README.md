Project Idea

This research addresses the critical challenge of automated toxic content detection in online communication platforms. The project proposes a deep learning-based system to classify user-generated text as toxic or non-toxic, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By automating content moderation, this system aims to mitigate the spread of harmful language while supporting scalable and efficient online discourse management.

Dataset Summary
The dataset is sourced from the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge in Kaggle , containing Wikipedia comments annotated with six toxicity labels: `toxic`, `severe toxic`, `obscene`, `threat`, `insult`, and `identity hate`. Each comment is multilabel-classified, with many exhibiting overlapping toxicity categories. To simplify the problem, the labels are aggregated into a binary classification task, where a comment is deemed "toxic" if it contains any of the six toxic attributes.

Key characteristics of the dataset include:
1. Imbalanced distribution: Non-toxic comments significantly outnumber toxic ones, reflecting real-world scenarios.
2. Text variability: Comments vary in length, linguistic complexity, and colloquial language usage.
3. Annotation granularity: The original multilabel structure enables nuanced toxicity analysis (though simplified here for binary classification).
Preprocessing involves tokenization (16,000-word vocabulary) and sequence padding to standardize input length (150 tokens), ensuring compatibility with neural network architectures.

Model Summary
The proposed model employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a recurrent architecture adept at capturing sequential dependencies in text. The structure comprises:
1. Embedding Layer: Maps tokenized words to 128-dimensional vectors, learning semantic relationships during training.
2. LSTM Layer: Processes sequences with 128 hidden units, extracting contextual features.
3. Regularization: A dropout layer (20% rate) mitigates overfitting.
4. Output Layer: Uses a sigmoid activation for binary classification.
5. The model is trained with `binary_crossentropy` loss and the `rmsprop` optimizer, incorporating early stopping to halt training if validation loss plateaus for 5 epochs. Evaluation on a 20% test split demonstrates robustness, with performance metrics focusing on classification accuracy.
Deployment: The finalized model is saved alongside its tokenizer, enabling seamless integration into real-world applications for toxicity detection. This approach balances computational efficiency with interpretability, making it suitable for content moderation tasks requiring real-time analysis.
Significance


This work contributes to the growing field of automated content moderation by demonstrating the efficacy of LSTMs in toxicity classification. The binary simplification broadens applicability to platforms requiring coarse-grained moderation, while the modular design allows for future expansion into multilabel classification.
